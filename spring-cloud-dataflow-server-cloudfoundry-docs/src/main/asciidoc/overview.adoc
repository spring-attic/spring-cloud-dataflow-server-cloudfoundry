[[spring-cloud-data-flow-overview]]
== Spring Cloud Data Flow
Spring Cloud Data Flow is a cloud-native programming and operating model for composable data microservices on a structured platform. With Spring Cloud Data Flow, developers can create and orchestrate data pipelines for common use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

The Spring Cloud Data Flow architecture is composed of several microservice projects, where the core specifications for streaming and batch data pipelines builds upon http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Spring Cloud Stream] and http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/[Spring Cloud Task] projects, respectively.

For more details about the core architecture components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Data Flow's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[core reference guide]. There're several https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples[samples] available for reference.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview]]
== Spring Cloud Stream
Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications, and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

For more details about the core framework components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Stream's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[reference guide].

There's a rich ecosystem of Spring Cloud Stream http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/{scst-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle[Application-Starters] that can be used either as standalone data microservice applications or in Spring Cloud Data Flow. For convenience, we have generated RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka variants of these application-starters that are available for use from http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/[Maven Repo] and https://hub.docker.com/r/springcloudstream/[Docker Hub] as maven artifacts and docker images, respectively.

Do you have a requirement to develop custom applications? No problem. Refer to this guide to create http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/{scst-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/#_creating_custom_artifacts[custom stream applications]. There're several https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[samples] available for reference.

[[spring-cloud-task-overview]]
== Spring Cloud Task

NOTE: This feature is actively being developed and it is yet to be supported in Spring Cloud Data Flow's Cloud Foundry server.

Spring Cloud Task makes it easy to create short-lived microservices. We provide capabilities that allow short-lived JVM processes to be executed on demand in a production environment.

For more details about the core framework components and the supported features, please review Spring Cloud Task's http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/{sct-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle/[reference guide].

There's a rich ecosystem of Spring Cloud Task http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task-app-starters/docs/{sct-starters-core-version}/reference/htmlsingle[Application-Starters] that can be used either as standalone data microservice applications or in Spring Cloud Data Flow. For convenience, the generated application-starters are available for use from http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/task/app/[Maven Repo]. There are several https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples[samples] available for reference.
