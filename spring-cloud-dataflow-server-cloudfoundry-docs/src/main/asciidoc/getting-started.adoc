== Deploying on Cloud Foundry

Spring Cloud Data Flow can be used to deploy modules in a Cloud Foundry environment. When doing so, the
server application can either run itself on Cloud Foundry, or on another installation (e.g. a simple laptop).

The required configuration amounts to the same in either case, and is merely related to providing credentials to the
Cloud Foundry instance so that the server can spawn applications itself. Any Spring Boot compatible configuration
mechanism can be used (passing program arguments, editing configuration files before building the application, using
link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config[Spring Cloud Config], using environment variables, etc.),
although some may prove more practicable than others when running _on_ Cloud Foundry.

NOTE: By default, the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-registry[application registry] in Spring Cloud Data Flow's Cloud Foundry server is empty. It is intentionally designed to allow users to have the flexibility of http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/html/_dsl_syntax.html#_register_a_stream_app[choosing and registering] applications, as they find appropriate for the given use-case requirement. Depending on the message-binder of choice, users can register between http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/[RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka] based maven artifacts.

=== Provision a redis service instance on Cloud Foundry.
Use `cf marketplace` to discover which plans are available to you, depending on the details of your Cloud Foundry setup.
For example when using link:https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services]:

```
cf create-service rediscloud 30mb redis
```

=== Provision a rabbit service instance on Cloud Foundry.
Use `cf marketplace` to discover which plans are available to you, depending on the details of your Cloud Foundry setup.
For example when using link:https://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services]:

```
cf create-service cloudamqp lemur rabbit
```

=== Download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server and Shell apps:

[subs=attributes]
```
wget http://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/{project-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry-{project-version}.jar
wget http://repo.spring.io/{dataflow-version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/{dataflow-project-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{dataflow-project-version}.jar
```

You can either deploy the server application on Cloud Foundry itself or on your local machine.
The following two sections explain each way of running the server.

[[running-on-cloudfoundry]]
=== Deploying the Server app on Cloud Foundry

Push the server application on Cloud Foundry, configure it (see below) and start it.

NOTE: You must use a unique name for your app; an app with the same name in the same organization will cause your
deployment to fail

[subs=attributes]
```
cf push dataflow-server --no-start -p spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry-{project-version}.jar
cf bind-service dataflow-server redis
cf bind-service dataflow-server rabbit
```

NOTE: If you are pushing to a space with multiple users, for example on PWS, there may already be a route taken for the
applicaiton name you have chosen. You can use the options `--random-route` to avoid this when pushing the app.

Now we can configure the app. The following configuration is for Pivotal Web Services. You need to fill in \{org}, \{space},
\{email} and \{password} before running these commands.

NOTE: Only set 'Skip SSL Validation' to true if you're running on a Cloud Foundry instance using self-signed
certs (e.g. in development). Do not use for production.

```
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_API_ENDPOINT https://api.run.pivotal.io
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORGANIZATION {org}
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE {space}
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN cfapps.io
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES redis,rabbit
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME {email}
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD {password}
cf set-env dataflow-server SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION false
```

We are now ready to start the app.

```
cf start dataflow-server
```

Alternatively, you can run the Admin application locally on your machine which is described in the next section.

=== Running the Server app locally

To run the server application locally, targeting your Cloud Foundry installation, you you need to configure the
application either by passing in command line arguments (see below) or setting a number of environment variables.

To use environment variables set the following:

```
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.run.pivotal.io
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORGANIZATION={org}
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE={space}
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN=cfapps.io
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES=redis,rabbit
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME={email}
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD={password}
export SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION=false
```

You need to fill in \{org}, \{space}, \{email} and \{password} before running these commands.

NOTE: Only set 'Skip SSL Validation' to true if you're running on a Cloud Foundry instance using self-signed
certs (e.g. in development). Do not use for production.

Now we are ready to start the server application:

[subs=attributes]
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry-{project-version}.jar [--option1=value1] [--option2=value2] [etc.]
```

=== Running Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell locally

Run the shell and optionally target the Admin application if not running on the same host (will typically be the case if
deployed on Cloud Foundry as explained xref:running-on-cloudfoundry[here])

[subs=attributes]
```
$ java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-{dataflow-project-version}.jar
```

```
server-unknown:>dataflow config server http://dataflow-server.cfapps.io
Successfully targeted http://dataflow-server.cfapps.io
dataflow:>
```

== Configuration Reference

The following pieces of configuration must be provided, e.g. by setting variables in the apps environment, or passing
variables on the Java invocation:

```
# Default values cited after the equal sign.
# Example values, typical for Pivotal Web Services, cited as a comment

# url of the CF API (used when using cf login -a for example), e.g. https://api.run.pivotal.io
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_API_ENDPOINT)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.apiEndpoint=

# name of the organization that owns the space above, e.g. youruser-org
# (For Setting Env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORGANIZATION)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.organization=

# name of the space into which modules will be deployed
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.space=<same space as server when running on CF, or 'development'>

# the root domain to use when mapping routes, e.g. cfapps.io
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.domain=

# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to the module.
# Amongst other things, this should include a service that will be used
# for Spring Cloud Stream binding
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.services=redis,rabbit

# username and password of the user to use to create apps (modules)
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME and SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.username=
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.password=

# Whether to allow self-signed certificates during SSL validation
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.skipSslValidation=false
```
