[[enable-disable-specific-features]]
== Feature Toggles

Data Flow server offers specific set of features that can be enabled/disabled when launching. These features include all the lifecycle operations, REST endpoints (server, client implementations including Shell and the UI) for:

. Streams
. Tasks
. Analytics

One can enable, disable these features by setting the following boolean properties when launching the Data Flow server:

* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.streams-enabled`
* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.tasks-enabled`
* `spring.cloud.dataflow.features.analytics-enabled`

By default, all the features are enabled.
Note: Since analytics feature is enabled by default, the Data Flow server is expected to have a valid Redis store available as analytic repository as we provide a default implementation of analytics based on Redis.
      This also means that the Data Flow server's `health` depends on the redis store availability as well.
      If you do not want to enabled HTTP endpoints to read analytics data written to Redis, then disable the analytics feature using the property mentioned above.

The REST endpoint `/features` provides information on the features enabled/disabled.


[[getting-started-security]]
== Security

By default, the Data Flow server is unsecured and runs on an unencrypted HTTP connection. You can secure your REST endpoints,
as well as the Data Flow Dashboard by enabling HTTPS and requiring clients to authenticate.
For more details about securing the
REST endpoints and configuring to authenticate against an OAUTH backend (_i.e: UAA/SSO running on Cloud Foundry_), please
review the security section from the core http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/html/getting-started-security.html[reference guide]. The security configurations can be configured in `dataflow-server.yml` or passed as environment variables through `cf set-env` commands.

[[getting-started-security-cloud-foundry]]
=== Authentication and Cloud Foundry

Spring Cloud Data Flow can either integrate with _Pivotal Single Sign-On Service_
(E.g. on PWS) or _Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication_ (UAA) Server.

[[getting-started-security-cloud-foundry-sso]]
==== Pivotal Single Sign-On Service

When deploying Spring Cloud Data Flow to Cloud Foundry you can simply bind the
application to the _Pivotal Single Sign-On Service_. By doing so, Spring Cloud
Data Flow takes advantage of the
 https://github.com/pivotal-cf/spring-cloud-sso-connector[_Spring Cloud Single Sign-On Connector_],
 which provides Cloud Foundry specific auto-configuration support for OAuth 2.0.

Simply bind the _Pivotal Single Sign-On Service_ to your Data Flow Server app and
Single Sign-On (SSO) via OAuth2 will be enabled by default.

Authorization is similarly support as for non-Cloud Foundry security scenarios.
Please refer to the security section from the core Data Flow http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/html/getting-started-security.html[reference guide].

As the provisioning of roles can vary widely across environments, we assign by
default all Spring Cloud Data Flow roles to users.

This can be customized by providing your own http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/oauth2/resource/AuthoritiesExtractor.html[AuthoritiesExtractor].

One possible approach to set the custom `AuthoritiesExtractor` on the `UserInfoTokenServices` could be this:

[source,java]
----
public class MyUserInfoTokenServicesPostProcessor
	implements BeanPostProcessor {

	@Override
	public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
		if (bean instanceof UserInfoTokenServices) {
			final UserInfoTokenServices userInfoTokenServices = (UserInfoTokenServices) bean;
			userInfoTokenServices.setAuthoritiesExtractor(ctx.getBean(AuthoritiesExtractor.class));
		}
		return bean;
	}

	@Override
	public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {
		return bean;
	}
}
----

And you simply declare it in your configuration class:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public BeanPostProcessor myUserInfoTokenServicesPostProcessor() {
	BeanPostProcessor postProcessor = new MyUserInfoTokenServicesPostProcessor();
	return postProcessor;
}
----

[[getting-started-security-cloud-foundry-uaa]]
==== Cloud Foundry UAA

The availability of this option depends on the used Cloud Foundry environment.
In order to provide UAA integration, you have to manually provide the necessary
OAuth2 configuration properties, for instance via the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`
property.

[source,json]
----
{
  "security.oauth2.client.client-id": "scdf",
  "security.oauth2.client.client-secret": "scdf-secret",
  "security.oauth2.client.access-token-uri": "https://login.cf.myhost.com/oauth/token",
  "security.oauth2.client.user-authorization-uri": "https://login.cf.myhost.com/oauth/authorize",
  "security.oauth2.resource.user-info-uri": "https://login.cf.myhost.com/userinfo"
}
----

By default, the property `spring.cloud.dataflow.security.cf-use-uaa` is set to `true`. This property will activate a special

http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/oauth2/resource/AuthoritiesExtractor.html[AuthoritiesExtractor] **CloudFoundryDataflowAuthoritiesExtractor**.

If CloudFoundry UAA is not used, then make sure to set `spring.cloud.dataflow.security.cf-use-uaa` to `false`.

Under the covers this _AuthoritiesExtractor_ will call out to the
https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/253/apps/retrieving_permissions_on_a_app.html[Cloud Foundry
Apps API] and ensure that users are in fact _Space Developers_.

If the authenticated user is verified as _Space Developer_, all roles will be assigned,
otherwise no roles whatsoever will be assigned. In that case you may see the following
Dashboard screen:

== Configuration Reference

The following pieces of configuration must be provided. These are Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties` so you can set
them as environment variables or by any other means that Spring Boot supports.  Here is a listing in environment
variable format as that is an easy way to get started configuring Boot applications in Cloud Foundry.

```
# Default values cited after the equal sign.
# Example values, typical for Pivotal Web Services, cited as a comment

# url of the CF API (used when using cf login -a for example), e.g. https://api.run.pivotal.io
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_URL)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.url=

# name of the organization that owns the space above, e.g. youruser-org
# (For Setting Env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORG)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.org=

# name of the space into which modules will be deployed, e.g. development
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.space=

# the root domain to use when mapping routes, e.g. cfapps.io
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.domain=

# username and password of the user to use to create apps
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME and SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.username=
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.password=

# Whether to allow self-signed certificates during SSL validation
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.skipSslValidation=false

# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to every stream app deployed.
# Amongst other things, this should include a service that will be used
# for Spring Cloud Stream binding, e.g. rabbit
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_SERVICES)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.stream.services=

# Health check type to use for stream apps. Accepts 'none' and 'port'
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.stream.health-check=


# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to every task app deployed.
# Amongst other things, this should include an RDBMS service that will be used
# for Spring Cloud Task execution reporting, e.g. my_mysql
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_TASK_SERVICES)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.task.services=

# Timeout to use, in seconds, when doing blocking API calls to Cloud Foundry.
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_TASK_API_TIMEOUT
# and SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_API_TIMEOUT)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.stream.apiTimeout=360
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.task.apiTimeout=360

# Timeout to use, in milliseconds, when querying the Cloud Foundry API to compute app status.
# (for setting env var use SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_TASK_STATUS_TIMEOUT
# and SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_STATUS_TIMEOUT)
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.stream.statusTimeout=5000
spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.task.statusTimeout=5000

```

Note that you can set the following properties `spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.services`,
`spring.cloud.deployer.cloudfoundry.buildpack` or the Spring Cloud Deployer standard
`spring.cloud.deployer.memory` and `spring.cloud.deployer.disk`
as part of an individual deployment request by using the `deployer.<app-name>` shortcut. For example

```
>stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log"
>stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "deployer.time.memory=2g"
```

will deploy the time source with 2048MB of memory, while the log sink will use the default 1024MB.

=== Understanding what's going on
If you want to get better insights into what is happening when your streams and tasks are being deployed, you may want
to turn on the following features:

* Reactor "stacktraces", showing which operators were involved before an error occurred. This is helpful as the deployer
relies on project reactor and regular stacktraces may not always allow understanding the flow before an error happened.
Note that this comes with a performance penalty, so is disabled by default.
+
```
spring.cloud.dataflow.server.cloudfoundry.debugReactor = true
```
* Deployer and Cloud Foundry client library request/response logs. This allows seeing detailed conversation between
the Data Flow server and the Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller.
+
```
logging.level.cloudfoundry-client = DEBUG

```

=== Using Spring Cloud Config Server
Spring Cloud Config Server can be used to centralize configuration properties for Spring Boot applications. Likewise,
both Spring Cloud Data Flow and the applications orchestrated using Spring Cloud Data Flow can be integrated with
config-server to leverage the same capabilities.

==== Stream, Task, and Spring Cloud Config Server
Similar to Spring Cloud Data Flow server, it is also possible to configure both the stream and task applications to resolve the centralized properties from config-server.
Setting the property `spring.cloud.config.uri` for the deployed applications is a common way to bind to the Config Server.
See the link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_spring_cloud_config_client[Spring Cloud Config Client] reference guide for more information.
Since this property is likely to be used across all applications deployed by the Data Flow server, the Data Flow Server's property `spring.cloud.dataflow.applicationProperties.stream` for stream apps and `spring.cloud.dataflow.applicationProperties.task` for task apps can be used to pass the `uri` of the Config Server to each deployed stream or task application.  Refer to the section on Common application properties for more information.


If you're using applications from the link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/[App Starters project], note that these applications already embed the `spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client` dependency.
If you're building your application from scratch and want to add the client side support for config server, simply add a reference dependency reference to the config server client library.  A maven example snippet follows:

[source,xml]
----
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-services-starter-config-client</artifactId>
  <version>CONFIG_CLIENT_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
...
----

Where, `CONFIG_CLIENT_VERSION` can be the latest release of https://github.com/pivotal-cf/spring-cloud-services-connector/releases[Spring Cloud Config Server]
client for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

NOTE: You will observe a `WARN` logging message if the application that uses this library can not connect to the config
server when the applicaiton starts and whenever the `/health` endpoint is accessed.
You can disable the client library if you know that you are not using config server functionality by setting the
environment variable `SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_ENABLED=false`.
Another, more drastic option, is to disable the platform health check with the environment variable
`SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_HEALTH_CHECK=none`

==== Sample Manifest Template
Following `manifest.yml` template includes the required env-var's for the Spring Cloud Data Flow server and deployed
apps/tasks to successfully run on Cloud Foundry and automatically resolve centralized properties from `my-config-server`
at the runtime.

[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: data-flow-server
  host: data-flow-server
  memory: 2G
  disk_quota: 2G
  instances: 1
  path: {PATH TO SERVER UBER-JAR}
  env:
    SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME: data-flow-server
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_URL: https://api.local.pcfdev.io
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORG: pcfdev-org
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE: pcfdev-space
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN: local.pcfdev.io
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME: admin
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD: admin
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_SERVICES: rabbit,my-config-server
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_TASK_SERVICES: mysql,my-config-server
    SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION: true
    SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON: '{"maven": { "remote-repositories": { "repo1": { "url": "https://repo.spring.io/libs-release"} } } }'
services:
- mysql
- my-config-server
----

Where, `my-config-server` is the name of the Spring Cloud Config Service instance running on Cloud Foundry. By binding the
service to both Spring Cloud Data Flow server as well as all the Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task applications
respectively, we can now resolve centralized properties backed by this service.

==== Self-signed SSL Certificate and Spring Cloud Config Server
Often, in a development environment, we may not have a valid certificate to enable SSL communication between clients and
the backend services. However, the config-server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry uses HTTPS for all client-to-service communication,
so it is necessary to add a self-signed SSL certificate in environments with no valid certificates.

Using the same `manifest.yml` template listed in the previous section, for the server, we can provide the self-signed
SSL certificate via: `TRUST_CERTS: <API_ENDPOINT>`.

However, the deployed applications __also__ require `TRUST_CERTS` as a _flat env-var_ (as opposed to being wrapped inside
`SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`), so we will have to instruct the server with yet another set of tokens `SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_STREAM_USE_SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON: false`
and `SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_TASK_USE_SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON: false` for stream and task applications
respectively. With this setup, the applications will receive their application properties as regular environment variables

Let's review the updated `manifest.yml` with the required changes. Both the Data Flow server and deployed applications
would get their config from the `my-config-server` Cloud Config server (deployed as a Cloud Foundry service)
